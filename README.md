### Bits & Books Project

Written By: Sean Kelley, Jack Kern, Tyra Shin, Justin Sparacino, Trey Thomas

#### About:

- This project is for our CSE-3241 class SP24. Our assignment was to create a database for a bookstore called 'Bits & Books'. For this project we used Sqlite and C# to create the database and a tool to add the data to the database. The database is pre-populated with data.

#### Loading Data:

- There is a C# Winforms application that allows you to pick a Sqlite Database and the Excel file of books and load them into the database. This form also allows you to add random test data to populate the rest of the database. You can also add customers, memberships, bookstores, inventories and purchases using the form.
- To use this, you must have the latest version of [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) installed. Then you should open up the .sln file found in the `/Bookstore.Form` directory. You should then be able to run the form.

#### Requirements:

- All of the requirements are in separate files based upon the rubric. We have a `Database Description` and `User Manual`, along with separate text files that store SQL queries, insert statements, delete statements and table definitions. We also have a folder with everything submitted in the checkpoints throughout the semester.
